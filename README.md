# Opportunity-Copilot
Students across India miss out on a lot of opportunities, for eg, hackathons, internships, summits,
scholarships, research programs , etc because of a lack of information in their local language. A lot of these
first generation students and those from tier 2/3 cities and universities are unaware of these opportunities and
miss out on them even if they are extremely skilled.
Opportunity Copilot is an AI-powered personalized opportunity discovery platform that matches students to
relevant internships, scholarships, hackathons, and research programs based on their profile, skills, and
goals.
It explains why they are eligible, provides step-by-step application guidance, tracks deadlines, and supports
local language interaction, ensuring that no student misses life-changing opportunities due to lack of
awareness.
